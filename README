NAME
    Alt - Alternate Module Implementations

SYNOPSIS
        cpanm Alt::IO::All::crackfueled

DESCRIPTION
    "Alt::" is the namespace for alternate implementations of CPAN modules.

    The purpose of the Alt module is to provide documentation explaining the
    Alt concept, how it works, and guidelines for using it well.

THE PROBLEM
    For a given piece of software, CPAN only allows for one implementation
    of a given module/distribution name.

    GitHub on the other hand, is not limited this way. Any author can make a
    fork, since GitHub repos are namespaced by author id.

    On CPAN, even the author(s) of the module in question is limited by
    this, as they cannot release newer or older forks of their code, without
    introducing a new name.

THE SOLUTION
    A module "Foo::Bar" is distributed on CPAN as "Foo-Bar". It may have
    submodules like "Foo::Bar::Baz".

    To make an alternate CPAN version, leave everything exactly the same,
    except distribute the new version as "Alt-Foo-Bar-AltIdentifier".

    When a user installs your module like so:

        cpanm Alt::Foo::Bar::better

    they will get your version of the Foo::Bar framework (Foo::Bar,
    Foo::Bar::Baz).

    Obviously, this completely overlays the old Foo::Bar install, but that's
    the whole idea. The user isn't surprised by this because they just asked
    for an Alternate implementation. If they don't like it, they can simply
    reinstall the original Foo-Bar, or try some other alternate.

WHENCE ALT?
    The Alt- concept was thought up by Ingy as he tried to figure out how to
    revamp the somewhat popular IO::All and YAML.pm modules. Alternates can
    now be released and alpha/beta tested, while the originals remain
    stable.

    When Alt-IO-All-new is "community approved" it can replace IO-All. If
    people want the old code, they can can install Alt-IO-All-old.

GUIDELINES
    This idea is new, and the details should be sorted out through proper
    discussions. Pull requests welcome.

    Here are the basic guidelines for using the Alt namespace:

    Name Creation
        Names for alternate modules should be minted like this:

            "Alt-$Original_Dist_Name-$phrase"

        For instance, if MSTROUT wants to make an alternate IO-All
        distribution to make it even more crack fueled, he might call it:

            Alt-IO-All-crackfueled

        He might also just call it:

            Alt-IO-All-MSTROUT

        By having 'Alt' at the start, it guarantees that it does not mess
        with future IO::All development. The "phrase" at the end can be
        anything unique to CPAN, but should describe the spirit of the
        alternate. If the alternate is meant to be short-lived, it can just
        be the author's CPAN id.

    Module for CPAN Indexing
        You will need to provide a module like "Alt::IO::All::MSTROUT" so
        that CPAN will index something that can cause your distribution to
        get installed by people:

            cpanm Alt::IO::All::MSTROUT

        Since you are adding this module, you should add some doc to it
        explaining your Alternate version's improvements.

    Versioning
        The VERSION of the module you are providing an alternate version of
        should be the same as the original module at the time you release
        the alternate. This will make it play well with others.

        To use the IO::All example, if MSTROUT releases Alt-IO-All-MSTROUT
        when IO::All is at version '0.46', his IO::All module should have
        VERSION = '0.46', but his Alt::IO::All::MSTROUT could be VERSION
        '0.000005'. This should make the dist be
        Alt-IO-All-MSTROUT-0.000005.

        If another module wants his version of IO::All, it should list
        Alt::IO::All::MSTROUT 0.000005 as a prereq, and then "use IO::All
        0.46;" in the code.

    no_index
        It is important to use the "no_index" directive on the modules you
        are providing an alternative to. This is especially important if you
        are the author of the original, as PAUSE will reindex CPAN to your
        Alt- version which defeats the purpose. Even if you are not the same
        author, it will make your index reports not show failures.

    Other Concerns
        If you have em, I(ngy) would like to know them. Discuss on
        #toolchain on irc.perl.org for now.
